Swedish organizations against email threats)

## Abstract
Email is an essential form of communication for organizations. Nevertheless, with
so much popularity came many challenges. These emails usually carry sensitive data
that might cause significant harm if they get compromised. Besides, spam and phishing
emails that continually reach the employees’ inbox masquerading as a trusted
entity due to the lack of authentication mechanisms are also considered a significant
threat for organizations today. Such threats are phishing using email domain
forgery attack, redirecting emails to a mail server that is under the attacker’s control,
and connection eavesdropping. The research aimed to investigate the vulnerability
of approximately 2000 organizations within Sweden against those attacks. Toward
that end, the quantity and quality of the following email security mechanisms SPF,
DKIM, DMARC, STARTTLS, DNSSEC, and DANE were examined through a case
study. Also, the adoption of these mechanisms was investigated, whether it varies
based on different factors such as organization size, sector, and location. The research
findings indicated that the average adoption rate by the tested organizations
was approximately 50%. Furthermore, the result demonstrated that there were no
differences in the adopted mechanisms based on the studied factors that the results
were quite similar among the tested groups. It concluded that there is a lack of protection
mechanisms, which made the majority of the tested organizations vulnerable
to different types of email attacks.
